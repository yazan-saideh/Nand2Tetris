# Nand2Tetris  

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the **Nand2Tetris** course, where I built a complete computer system from basic logic gates to a fully functional operating system.  

## Overview  
The Nand2Tetris course is a hands-on journey through computer architecture and software development. It covers everything from digital logic circuits to high-level programming and operating systems. This repository documents my progress, code implementations, and insights gained throughout the course.  

## Projects  
Each directory corresponds to a specific project from the course:  

- `project01` - Boolean logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.)  
- `project02` - Arithmetic logic (Adders, ALU)  
- `project03` - Sequential logic (Flip-flops, registers, RAM)  
- `project04` - Machine language (Hack Assembly)  
- `project05` - CPU implementation (Hack Computer)  
- `project06` - Assembler (Translates Hack Assembly to binary)  
- `project07` - Virtual Machine I (Stack operations)  
- `project08` - Virtual Machine II (Program control flow)  
- `project09` - High-Level Language (Jack Programming)  
- `project10` - Compiler I (Lexical & syntax analysis)  
- `project11` - Compiler II (Code generation)  
- `project12/allOs` - Building an operating system  

## What I Learned  
Throughout this course, I gained knowledge and hands-on experience in:  

âœ… Designing logic gates and circuits using **Boolean algebra**  
âœ… Understanding and building a **central processing unit (CPU)**  
âœ… Writing programs in **Hack Assembly language**  
âœ… Implementing an **Assembler** to convert assembly to binary machine code  
âœ… Developing a **stack-based virtual machine**  
âœ… Learning **compilers** by building a simple compiler for the Jack language  
âœ… Constructing an **operating system** with memory management, I/O handling, and process control  
âœ… Programming in **low-level and high-level languages**
